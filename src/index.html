            [Verse 1] We're no strangers to love You know the rules and so do I
            A full commitment's what I'm thinking of You wouldn't get this from
            any other guy [Pre-Chorus] I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
            Gotta make you understand [Chorus] Never gonna give you up Never
            gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna
            make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt
            you [Verse 2] We've known each other for so long Your heart's been
            aching, but you're too shy to say it Inside, we both know what's
            been going on We know the game, and we're gonna play it [Pre-Chorus]
            And if you ask me how I'm feeling Don't tell me you're too blind to
            see [Chorus] Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never
            gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna
            say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you Never gonna give you
            up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you
            Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a
            lie and hurt you [Post-Chorus] Ooh (Give you up) Ooh-ooh (Give you
            up) Ooh-ooh Never gonna give, never gonna give (Give you up) Ooh-ooh
            Never gonna give, never gonna give (Give you up) [Bridge] We've
            known each other for so long Your heart's been aching, but you're
            too shy to say it Inside, we both know what's been going on We know
