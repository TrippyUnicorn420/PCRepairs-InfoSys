            [Verse 1] Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me I ain't
            the sharpest tool in the shed She was looking kind of dumb with her
            finger and her thumb In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
            [Pre-Chorus] Well, the years start comin' and they don't stop comin'
            Fed to the rules and I hit the ground runnin' Didn't make sense not
            to live for fun Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb So
            much to do, so much to see So what's wrong with taking the
            backstreets? You'll never know if you don't go (W-w-wacko) You'll
            never shine if you don't glow [Chorus] Hey now, you're an all star
            Get your game on, go play Hey now, you're a rock star Get the show
            on, get paid (And all that glitters is gold) Only shootin' stars
            break the mold [Verse 2] It's a cool place, and they say it gets
            colder You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older But the meteor
            men beg to differ Judging by the hole in the satellite picture The
            ice we skate is getting pretty thin The water's getting warm so you
            might as well swim My world's on fire, how 'bout yours? That's the
            way I like it and I'll never get bored [Chorus] Hey now, you're an
            all star Get your game on, go play Hey now, you're a rock star Get
            the show on, get paid (All that glitters is gold) Only shootin'
            stars break the mold [Interlude] Go for the moon (W-w-wacko,
            w-w-wacko) Go for the moon (W-w-wacko, w-w-wacko) Go for the moon Go
            for the moon [Chorus] Hey now, you're an all star Get your game on,
            go play Hey now, you're a rock star Get the show on, get paid (And
            all that glitters is gold) Only shooting starsâ€¦ [Verse 3] Somebody
            once asked, "Could I spare some change for gas? I need to get myself
            away from this place" I said, "Yep, what a concept I could use a
            little fuel myself and we could all use a little change"
            [Pre-Chorus] Well, the years start comin' and they don't stop comin'
            Fed to the rules and I hit the ground runnin' Didn't make sense not
            to live for fun Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb So
            much to do, so much to see So what's wrong with taking the
            backstreets? You'll never know if you don't go (Go!) You'll never
            shine if you don't glow [Chorus] Hey now, you're an all star Get
            your game on, go play Hey now, you're a rock star Get the show on,
            get paid (And all that glitters is gold) Only shootin' stars break
            the mold [Outro] (And all that glitters is gold) Only shooting stars
            break the mold
