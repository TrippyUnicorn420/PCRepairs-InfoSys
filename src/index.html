      There was a time I used to look into my father's eyes In a happy home I
      was a king, I had a golden throne Those days are gone Now they're memories
      on the wall I hear the songs from the places where I was born Up on a hill
      across the blue lake That's where I had my first heartbreak I still
      remember how it all changed My father said Don't you worry, don't you
      worry, child See heaven's got a plan for you Don't you worry, don't you
      worry now Yeah Don't you worry, don't you worry now Yeah Don't you worry,
      don't you worry now Yeah There was a time I met a girl of a different kind
      We ruled the world I thought I'd never lose her out of sight We were so
      young I think of her now and then I still hear the songs reminding me of a
      friend Up on a hill across the blue lake That's where I had my first
      heartbreak I still remember how it all changed My father said Don't you
      worry, don't you worry, child See heaven's got a plan for you Don't you
      worry, don't you worry now Yeah Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
      Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
      Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh See heaven's got a plan for you
      See heaven's got a plan for you See heaven's got a plan for you Don't you
      worry, don't you worry, child See heaven's got a plan for you Don't you
      worry, don't you worry now Yeah Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
      Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Yeah
