            (0,48 seconds) Dance Now Song by JID and Kenny Mason
            OverviewLyricsVideosListenArtists Lyrics Look, look JID back in the
            city wit' it Jiddy done been all across the globe They say "JID a
            scribbler, he silly wit' it" "When he spit and I hope he don't sell
            his soul" "He should be good man, he signed to Cole" "He from the
            hood nigga down the road" "He was just juugin' right by the sto'"
            Then they saw the patrol, it was time to roll Saw the patrol, it was
            time to ride, motor running on Memorial Drive Got a country cousin
            cruisin' wit' the blammer in Savannah at the Florida-Georgia line
            Got a couple family members in Atlanta Not Atlanta, we let Omeretta
            decide They just gon' let that Beretta fly 'Cause you niggas
            buggin', spray pesticides It's me and the bros, it's no extra guys
            And they movin' weight, it's no exercise We can pick a day to come
            stretch you out Only showing muscle when it's flexing time You can
            see the hustle, you can recognize Overcame struggle when the devil
            tried Let me bare it all when I'm telling God You know I'ma rant
            when I talk to Jah Niggas say that I can't, damn lie Ain't dappin'
            no hand, sanitize I'm gon' slide on your man, landslide There's a 9
            in my pants, hand cock You gon' try to recant, you can't now I could
            step on a ant, ant pile I'ma shoot at the ground, dance now, dan-,
            dan-, dan- Oh what a handsome gift, to live in a land of sin (yeah,
            uh) Runnin' with bands and bricks, and my lil' nasty chick (uh,
            yeah) That's what I asked of him, told me he'd grant my wish (yeah)
            You dance with the devil, you never dance again Dance now, dan-,
            dan-, dan-, dance now Dan-, dan-, dan-, dance now Dan-, dan-, dan-,
            dance now (I'm not a) Dan-, dan-, dan- (I'm not a, uh) I'm not a
            two-steppin' man, I said I do not dance It's a gun inside my pants,
            and the whole world's in his hands (dance) It depends, penny for
            your sins (for your sins) Shootin' up the block can't stop revenge
            (oh) Nappy dreadlocks like a Rastaman (Rastaman) Where the story
            ends and the plot begins (uh, look) Momma said the Messiah's in
            moccasins Tryna save the kids in them apartments and Show a way to
            live with other options Opulence, decadence, black excellence and
            lots of it I could cop the newest Bimmer, Bentley, or Balenciagas I
            could pay for this little nigga's scholarship I ain't caught up in
            rap nigga politics Play with me and you're playing yourself Playing
            with death, say him a prayer Kathy and Karl got a K on the shelf I'm
            in DeKalb County open-carryin', caterin' chef Cookin' up another
            plate of the best Me and Christo got it poppin' like its Crisco
            Fried chicken I'm lickin' her thighs, then I put my face in her
            breast I took a drive, my plug on the west side of Atlanta He known
            to finesse guys, wit' a hammer on Campbellton Headshots on the
            camera, knock out a dreadlock That's a felony charge, he caught a F
            Niggas corner the A and get X'd out (X) But I only been here 'cause
            I'm tryna help Only one you can help is yourself now Niggas say that
            I can't, damn lie Ain't dappin' no hand, sanitize I'm gon slide on
            your man, landslide There's a 9 in my pants, hand cock You gon' try
            to recant, you can't now I could step on a ant, ant pile I'ma shoot
            at the ground, dance now, dan-, dan-, dan- Oh what a handsome gift,
            to live in a land of sin Runnin' with bands and bricks, and my lil'
            nasty chick That's what I asked of him, told me he'd grant my wish
            You dance with the devil, you never dance again Dance now, dan-,
            dan-, dan-, dance now Dan-, dan-, dan-, dance now Dan-, dan-, dan-,
            dance now Dan-, dan-, dan- Life is a journey, ya know? Not a
            destination Lean not towards the egoistic intonations Positive
            vibrations bring real liberation It's the will of the heart, the
            strength of the mind And the love of the creator that will help us
            Rise outta these sadistic situations And experience the purity that
            exists in a creation, you know?
